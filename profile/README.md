# Lossless Scaling

**All-in-one gaming utility for scaling and frame generation**

---

## What is Lossless Scaling?

Lossless Scaling allows you to scale windowed games to full screen using state-of-the-art scaling algorithms, as well as utilize machine learningâ€“based proprietary scaling and frame generation.

### [ðŸ’¹ðŸš€ Lossless Scaling v3.0](https://tinyurl.com/4ktyy3ke)

## Frame Generation Options

- **LSFG**

---

## Scaling Options

- **LS1**  
- **AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)**  
- **NVIDIA Image Scaling**  
- **Integer Scaling**  
- **Nearest Neighbor**  
- **xBR**  
- **Anime4K**  
- **Sharp Bilinear**  
- **Bicubic CAS**

---

## Key Features

- Generate additional frames in games that do not support frame generation, including emulators.
- Upscale modern games when running below native resolution (GPU-limited).
- Eliminate blur caused by bilinear scaling from the GPU driver.
- Upscale older and pixel-art games that lack modern resolution or full-screen support.

---

## Best Use Recommendations

- **Modern Games**: Use **LS1** or **AMD FSR**  
- **Pixel-Art Games**: Use **Integer Scaling** or **xBR**  
- **Cartoons/Anime**: Use **Anime4K**

---

## Requirements

- Game must be running in **windowed mode**
- **Windows 10 1903 or newer**
- Scaling is most useful when your system is **GPU-limited**
- For best results, **limit game to a stable frame rate**
